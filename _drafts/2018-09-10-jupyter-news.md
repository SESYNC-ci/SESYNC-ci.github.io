The latest addition to SESYNC's cyberinfrastructure---rolling out on
September 20^th^---is a JupyterHub gateway for Python based data
analysis and visualization. [Project Jupyter] makes interactive
notebooks available through your web browser, allowing data scientists
to create and share documents that combine runnable code, its output,
text with mathematical notation, and visualizations.

As on our long-running [RStudio Server], SESYNC researchers can access
[JupyterHub] with their current username and password and reach all the
Center's cyberinfrastructure (research data directory, research
home directory, database servers, and the compute cluster) from Jupyter.
 
Participants at the most recent Summer Institute may recognize the
interface from the [introduction to Python], and other users of our RStudio
Server may find that a good starting point for trying out Jupyter.

Check out the [Quick Start] guide.



What will this allow users to do?

How similar/different to RStudio/existing resources
