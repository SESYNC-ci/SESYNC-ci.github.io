JupyterHub news/blog


 
SESYNC is launching a new service for SESYNC teams and researchers: a Jupyter notebook server. Like our popular RStudio server, Jupyter lab is integrated with other SESYNC computing services like databases, file storage, compute cluster, and can be accessed with the same login credentials. 
 
Participants at the most recent Summer Institute may recognize the interface from the Python-based lessons on [classification]() and [online data](). 
 
What will this allow users to do?

*from jupyter.org*

> The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.
