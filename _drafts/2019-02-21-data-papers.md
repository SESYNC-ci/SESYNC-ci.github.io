Examples of data papers – a variety of ways to think about publishing a “data description” article that either includes or refers to the actual dataset. This is by no means comprehensive but I tried to pick a few very different ones.

Yeager et al 2017 Marine Socio-Environmental Covariates – This is an Ecology data paper and was an outcome from a SESYNC postdoc project and actually has a [shiny app](https://shiny.sesync.org/apps/msec/) as well for querying and downloading subsets of the data. The paper is basically just the abstract, but has all the detail in the metadata (the attached word document) that describes how each variable was calculated. The metadata also links to the [github repository](https://github.com/pmarchand1/msec) with all of the processing code. [This link](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/hub/journal/19399170/resources/data_paper_inst_ecy) describes Ecology data papersIf you are interested in using the SESYNC styling template (https://github.com/SESYNC-ci/shiny-template) we can help with that too. As described at the journal website link, the metadata is a word document that describes many different aspects and details of the data but is a little less standardized than what is typically expected for a domain-specific repository.

Stanley et al. 2016 Ecology of methane in streams and rivers – This paper is in Ecological Monographs and describes (and cites) a dataset that is hosted separately on the LTER’s data portal. The paper has a lot of descriptive statistics and interpretation/conceptual analysis. The dataset is a series of linked csv files and is described with Ecological Metadata Language which you can see [here](https://portal.lternet.edu/nis/metadataviewer?packageid=knb-lter-ntl.321.5375841).

Salguero-Gomez et al. 2015 – This is a Journal of Ecology paper describing a version of the COMPADRE plant matrix database which is hosted at [https://www.compadre-db.org/](https://www.compadre-db.org/). The supporting information for the paper has several appendices that include user guides and R scripts for accessing the data and doing common operations.

Appling et al. 2018 – this is an example from Scientific Data, which is in the Nature family of journals and open access. They do not host the data described in the publications, but their website [here](http://www.nature.com/sdata/policies/repositories#general) has some nice guidelines and recommendations for both domain specific and generalist data repositories. The journal submission process is integrated with two of the generalist repositories (Figshare and Dryad). You can see more examples from the Ecology subject area [here](https://www-nature-com/search?subject=ecology&journal=sdata).
