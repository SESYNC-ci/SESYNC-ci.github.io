Numbers so far
==============

Optimized code: Extra setup script ran on 1 processor for 1066 seconds. Then the uncertainty analysis took 29 seconds to run 100 iterations. (232 processor seconds, so 2.32 seconds per iteration)

Unoptimized code: No extra setup script. Then the uncertainty analysis took 158 seconds to run 3 iterations, and 2756 seconds to run 100 iterations. (22048 processor seconds, so 220.48 seconds per iteration)

Calculation:

`((2756*8*100)-(29*8*100 + 1066))/3600`

Result: 606 processor-hours saved
Optimized code ran 6:45 processor-hours
Unoptimized code ran 612:30 processor-hours

Power consumption in HPCC: A few sources found, it looks like it varies from around 60-200 W per core when running the job. (will add details)

Data to get GHG intensity of energy generation in Maryland: excel sheets with required data are at https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=74&t=11

The rough calculation shows 0.333 kg (333 g) per kWh. That's a bit less than driving a car a mile.

Comparisons: Netflix? car? burger?

GHG footprint of driving one mile: https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/greenhouse-gas-emissions-typical-passenger-vehicle (404 g )
Carbon footprint of hamburger: https://www.sixdegreesnews.org/archives/10261/the-carbon-footprint-of-a-cheeseburger

So we have 606 processor hours saved, 60 to 200 W generated per core, and 0.333 kg CO2 per 1000 W per hour.

Range of kWh saved is `606*.06` to `606*.2` which is about 36 to 121 kWh. So that's actually 12 to 40 kg CO2. Equivalent to driving a car 30 to 100 miles.
