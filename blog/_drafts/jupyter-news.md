The latest addition to SESYNC's cyberinfrastructure---rolling out on
September 20^th^---is a JupyterHub gateway for Python based data
analysis and visualization. [Project Jupyter] makes interactive
notebooks available through a web browser, allowing data scientists to
create and share documents that combine runnable code, its output,
narratives with mathematical notation, and visualizations.

As on our long-running [RStudio Server], SESYNC researchers can access
[JupyterHub] using their current login credentials and reach all the
Center's cyberinfrastructure (research data directory, research
home directory, database servers, and the compute cluster) from Jupyter.

Participants at the most recent Summer Institute will recognize the
interface from their [introduction to Python]; other users of our
RStudio Server may find this lesson a good starting point for trying
out Jupyter. For a brief overview, check out the [Quick Start] guide.
