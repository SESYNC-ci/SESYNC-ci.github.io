# Notes on energy use of data centers

* Global is approx 1%
* US is approx 1.8%

Maryland energy, highest source is natural gas: https://www.eia.gov/state/?sid=MD#tabs-1

* State of MD has a grant program for data center energy efficiency, The University of Maryland is a past DCEEG awardee who used their grant funds to replace a data center cooling system that  reduced the HVAC energy costs at that location by over 45%.

University of Maryland
* PUE at 2 large data centers at UMD in 2018 was 2.1 and 1.7 (Battaglia et al 2018); at 3 small data centers and server rooms on campus ranged from 1.6 to 2.7 (Patel at al 2019). Average for "closet" sized data centers is 2.0 (Shehabi et al 2018) while world-class hyperscale data centers operate close to the practical minimum ~ 1.1

Masanet et al 2020 Science
* data centers are estimated to account for around 1% of worldwide electricity use
* often cited stats based on simplistic analyses claim that energy usage by data centers has doubled over the past decade and energy use will triple or even quadruple within the next decade

Masanet and Lei 2020 Q1 Research review for Aspen global change institute. How much energy do data centers really use?
* official stats are not currently compiled on data center energy use at national or global levels. 
* most authoratative bottom up estimate is from 2011 and estimated 1.1-1.5% global electricity use for data centers in 2010
* extrapolation based models estimate use based on previous bottom up values and scaling them based on growth indicators like global IP traffic or data center investments
* The finding that global data centers likely consumed around 205 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2018, or 1 percent of global electricity use, lies in stark contrast to earlier extrapolation-based estimates that showed rapidly-rising data center energy use over the past decade.
* Unfortunately, it is not yet possible to accurately estimate total CO2 emissions, due to a lack of data on the locations of the vast majority of global data centers and the emissions intensities (measured in grams CO2 per kilowatt-hour) of their actual electricity sources. Only a handful of companies, including Google, Apple, Switch, and Facebook publicly report such data, indicating a growing trend among some of the world’s largest data center operators toward renewable energy procurement
* one oft-repeated claim is that the world’s data centers emit as much CO2 as the global aviation industry 
* Another recent claim is that “the emissions generated by watching 30 minutes of Netflix (1.6 kg of CO2) is the same as driving almost four miles.” This claim is backed up by assumptions that data centers providing Netflix streaming services would consume around 370 TWh per year (Kamiya 2020). Yet this value is 1.8 times larger than the 205 TWh estimated for all of the world’s data centers combined, which provide society with myriad other information services beyond just streaming Netflix videos. (For a more complete assessment, see Kamiya 2020.)

* includes covid trends/impacts - global internet traffic surged almost 40% between Feb and mid-April 2020
* global data center electricity demand in 2019 was around 0.8% of global demand

Jones, N. 2018 Nature news feature
* data centers use an estimated 200 teratt hours each year (200 TWh), which is more than national energy consumption of some countries but half of the electricity used for transport, and 1% of global electricity demand. contribute 0.3% to overall carbon emissions. 
* ICT overall (information and communications technology, which includes personal digital devises, mobile phone networks, and tv) accounts for more than 2% of global emissions, which is on par with emissions from aviation fuel
* right now rising demand is countered by increased efficiencies but uncertain if that will keep pace 
* streamlining computing processes, switching to renewables, and investigating better ways to cool data centers and recycle waste heat
* high end forecast is ICT will use 8% of energy demand by 2030, but but usage demand has always far outpaced electricity demand
* power use efficiency (PUE) - total energy needed for for everything divided by energy used for computing (PUE = 1 is perfect score)

Shehabi et al 2016 LBNL report
* 2014, data centers in US consumed about 1.8% of total US electricity consumption
