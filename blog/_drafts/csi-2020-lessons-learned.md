Over the last few months, many people have conducted instructional courses virtually and shared their experiences [online].  In that respect, our reflections below on what we learned conducting a virtual course this summer are not ground-breaking.  We provide them for those who attended the course, for our future selves, and anyone else interested in our specific instructional circumstances. 

###Our instructional set-up: 

- online syllabus with links to course information and all lesson materials 
- each lesson completely in text form as a website
- series of short live-coding videos to supplement (not replace) each lesson
- computational "lab" provided to participants via web-brower log-in
- all software, data, and lesson materials pre-installed for participants in lab
- office hours and exercise review Zoom calls with 2 instructors
- Slack workspace for the course with channels for each team, each day, and general and welcome also
- video calling with screen sharing for teams in Slack
- personalized team coaching on Zoom calls

### What worked as expected: 

- combination of tools for collaborative virtual work was successful (Slack, Zoom, etc.)
- supplemental coding videos received very positive feedback from participants

### What didn't quite work as expected:

- We offered a technology testing opportunity 5 days in advance, but literally no one called in.  However, there were issues throughout the week with software installation, connection issues, other questions about technology that could have been solved in advance. 
- Participants didn't attend office hours to review exercises or ask questions as much as we expected.  Therefore, it was really difficult to understand whether students actually engaged with the lesson materials or not.  We expected these office hours to function as "collaborative debugging sessions" but no one brought their "bugs".  
- Participants didn't fill out the polls for what lesson exercises they wanted to cover in office hours.  We therefore stopped putting out the polls, but after the course received feedback that participants expected us to walk through the exercises.  In-person, we used to use stickies (one sticky for positive comments, one sticky for struggles that day).  
- After the course, we received the feedback that it was unclear how to apply the lesson material to their own project.  We provided ample office hours time, and participants didn't ask us this during office hours.  
- Participants didn't block off the entire week for this course, as we had expected them to.  This made it incredibly difficult to foster a community among participants, because many people did not call in to the "all participants" parts of the course.  
- Most participants kept their video off a lot.  This did not foster community, and made it hard to read participants (no non-verbal communication).   

### What can we do differently next time:

- Make acceptance to the course contingent on agreeing to a participants code of conduct that will address the issues outlined above.
- Require everyone to keep their video on at all times during course video calls
- Find a way to assess participant learning everyday in the absence of sticky note feedback.
