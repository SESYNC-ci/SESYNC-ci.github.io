Over the last few months, many people have conducted instructional courses virtually and shared their experiences [online].  In that respect, our reflections below are not ground-breaking.  We provide the following thoughs on what we learned conducting a virtual course this summer for our future selves, for those who attended the course, and anyone else interested in our specific instructional circumstances. 

Our instructional set-up: 
- online syllabus with links to all lesson materials and other course information
- each lesson completely in text form as a website
- series of short live-coding videos to supplement each lesson
- computational "lab" provided to participants via web-brower log-in
- all software, data, and lesson materials pre-installed for participants in lab
- office hours and exercise review Zoom calls with 2 instructors
- Slack workspace for the course with channels for each team, each day, and general and welcome also
- video calling with screen sharing for teams in Slack
-
