Choosing to put your data products in a long-term repository can:

- let others find and access your dataset
- provide a permanent uniquely identifiable code (DOI) for citing your dataset
- enable re-use and greater visibility of your work

Data repositories vary in many ways including their specificity of topics and data types, requirements for submission, the types and formats of data they will accept, and level of curation. In general, you should (1) put your data where there are other similar types of data, and (2) include descriptive high-quality metadata that describes the dataset. Domain-specific repositories sometimes require adherence to standards for file formats and/or metadata, such as [Ecological Metadata Language](https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/) used by the ecology-focused [Knowledge Network for Biodiversity](https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/), [Darwin Core](http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/) for biodiversity data, or the very general [Dublin Core](http://dublincore.org/metadata-basics/).

Here are a few potential repositories to consider, resources, and tools: 

- [Dryad](http://datadryad.org/) is one of several generic data repositories that is very flexible and can accept many forms of data. Dryad has a base charge $120 for hosting any dataset under 20 GB. Many journals have [submission integration](http://datadryad.org/pages/submissionIntegration) to coordinate reviewing and publishing manuscripts and data. 

- The [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/) is another generic data repository that accepts individual files up to 2.5 GB and datasets up to 10 GB. 

- The [Environmental Data Initiative](https://environmentaldatainitiative.org/) hosts a data portal for environmental and ecological data, including data from Long-Term Ecological Research sites. As a domain-specific repository, it covers a narrower range of data but can offer more intense data curation with more ways to browse and search for data of interest. 

- Qualitative data can be hosted at the [Qualitative Data Respository](https://qdr.syr.edu/)

- The University of Maryland Library [Research Data Services](https://www.lib.umd.edu/data/dmp) provides a detailed description of data management plans, including examples.

- [Github](https://github.com/) repositories can be assigned DOIs through [Zenodo](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/) and serve as a long-term repository for models and code products. Some types of modeling communities may have specialized repositories, such as [Open ABM](https://www.openabm.org/models) for agent-based models.

- Several journals specialize in data publications such as [Scientific Data](http://www.nature.com/sdata/), and [Earth System Science Data](http://www.earth-system-science-data.net/), whereas other journals have specialized article formats for this type of manuscript, such as [Ecology data papers](http://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/hub/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)1939-9170/resources/data_paper_inst_ecy.html). 

- To find other data respositories, you can search [Data ONE](https://www.dataone.org/current-member-nodes) member nodes, or in the [Registry of Research Data Repositories](http://www.re3data.org/)
