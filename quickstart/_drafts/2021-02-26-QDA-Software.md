Qualitative data analysis (QDA) is the process of searching for patterns and themes in large volumes of unstructured textual data to help answer relevant research questions. This research method commonly uses computers to search for these connections in your data by employing QDA software. 

Here are some common examples of qualitative data: 
* Interviews 
* Focus Groups
* Observations 
* Short text surveys
* Video or Audio Transcripts 
* Secondary research (e.g. social media data, journal articles, historical records)

Qualitative data analysis can be a great asset to your research project and will allow you to effectively transform unstructured data. 

# Using QDA software

QDA software assists with organizing, annotating, searching and displaying your data.  You can import your data into QDA software so all of your data lives in one location and is directly linked to your project files. 

Please note that QDA software is not able to analyze your data but rather is a tool for engaging with data. Plan to use QDA software as a way to organize and access information about your data more quickly and easily to assist with research analysis. 

 “The central analytic task in qualitative research- understanding the meaning of text – cannot be computerized” (Kelle, 1995)

# Choosing the right QDA software

The best software for your project depends entirely on your unique project’s needs. 

If you’re planning on using QDA software, first consider your research question and envision what you expect to learn from your analysis. This will help you determine what methods and software will best meet your project’s goals. 

Here are some important questions to consider: 
* What type of data do you have? (e.g. tables, videos, transcripts)
* How are you planning to transform your data?
* Do the software’s unique features support your methodology? 
* How do you want your data visualized and exported? 
* Is there a software learning community to join? 

These considerations early on in the research process will help you to select the best software for your research aims and ultimately save you time and effort in completing your qualitative data analysis.

# Free and/or open source QDA software

There are a variety of free and open source QDA software choices.  If time permits, it may be a useful starting point to begin playing with your data in a [free and open-source QDA platform](https://guides.library.illinois.edu/c.php?g=348074&p=2346107). 

These software options tend to have more basic functionality, giving you the opportunity to explore what features you need and don’t need, before deciding to invest time and funds in more sophisticated software.  Some of these options also make use of R, so if you are already an experienced R coder this may be a good time saving option.

Lastly, many QDA software options that charge for use offer a free trial. Use this as an opportunity to explore how the software is displaying, organizing and exporting your data.
