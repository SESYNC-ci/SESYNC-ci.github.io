*What we can provide*

Free zoom limits meetings to 45 minutes. We can provide access to enterprise zoom and schedule meetings for your team without a time limit. A SESYNC staff member will need to schedule the meeting and be the meeting "host"


# Meeting Roles

See zoom documentation [here](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360040324512-Roles-in-a-meeting
) including a comprehensive table

## Host

* This is the person who schedules and starts the meeting. A meeting can start without a host depending on the meeting settings. 
* A meeting can have only one host at a time, but the host can transfer this role once a meeting has started.
* Only the host can: assign participants to breakout rooms, create a poll, assign other guests as hosts, control who participants can chat with, or end a meeting for all users
* Note that the host cannot see private messages between participants

## Co-host

* Once a meeting starts, the host can assign co-host role to meeting participants
* There is no limit on the number of co-hosts
* Co-hosts can manage participants such as mute/unmute all or select participants, remove attendees
* Co-hosts cannot answer polls, only guests

# Screen sharing 

* If you want to share content with audio, make sure to click "share computer sound"
* See zoom documentation [here](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/203395347-Screen-Sharing-a-PowerPoint-Presentation) specifically on sharing a powerpoint presentation
* You can enable annotation/drawing on shared content, or on a blank "whiteboard" space e.g. for drawing diagrams. See zoom documentation [here](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115005706806-Using-annotation-tools-on-a-shared-screen-or-whiteboard)

# Breakout Rooms

# Random

* Obtain consent from all individuals prior to recording a meeting
* The web client has limited features compared to the desktop or phone app, e.g. screen sharing may depend on your operating system. See table [here](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360027397692#note)
* You can schedule one-time meetings, recurring meetings, or start a meeting "on the fly"
* Good reference on how to arrange screen [here](https://keepteaching.iu.edu/resources/zoom/pin-video.html)
