Your SESYNC username is your first initial plus last name, (ie: "John Smith" is
jsmith).

You can also lookup your usename at <https://pwm.sesync.org/> using the 'Forgotten
Username' link and the email address we have on file. If you don't know the email
address you have registered with us, please contact *cyberhelp@sesync.org*.
