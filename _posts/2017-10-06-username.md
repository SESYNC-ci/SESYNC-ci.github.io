A SESYNC username is usually your first initial followed by your last name, (i.e. "John Smith" is
`jsmith`). Common or very long names may not follow this pattern.

You can lookup your usename at [pwm.sesync.org](https://pwm.sesync.org/) using the "Forgotten
Username" link and the email address you initially registered. If you don't know the email
address you registered, please contact **{{ site.email }}**.
