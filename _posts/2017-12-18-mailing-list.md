SESYNC uses the sympa mailing list server to manage mailing lists. 
You can manage your list by going to https://lists.sesync.org and entering your e-mail address and SESYNC password in the upper right. 

**Unlike other SESYNC services,  you will need to use the e-mail address attached to your account (ie, bsmith@university.edu) and not your SESYNC username.**

Once you login, you will see a list of lists for which you are an administrator on the left. 
Click the found 'admin' button to the left of the list you want to modify.
