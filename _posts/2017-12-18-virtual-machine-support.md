## Types of virtual machines available

SESYNC has the ability to deploy custom Windows and Linux Virtual Machines for use by groups. 
If there is a software or service needed that is not provided by our shared infrastructure,
we can deploy a virtual machine to meet your needs.


## Cyberinfrastructure staff support of virtual machines

* Virtual Machines will be managed by SESYNC CI IT staff including:
  * Security patches applied regularly during SESYNC's monthly maintenance windows
  * Backups taken daily and kept for 30 days in case of data loss
  * Monitored by SESYNC CI staff for uptime and availability

SESYNC reserves the right to perform emergency patching on all services hosted at SESYNC at any time without warning.
Depending on the severity of the vulnerability, there may be a litmited time window between when an exploit is announced and whe
malicious users are actively exploiting the vulnerability.
