Partway through her LTER Postdoc at SESYNC, ecologist Meghan Avolio ran into trouble manipulating her data on plant communities with `dplyr` functions. I had encouraged Meghan to modularize her scripts by writing functions for common steps in her pipeline (such as converting count data into rank-abundance curves). "You'll love writing functions!" I said wrongly.

Meghan quickly ran up against the trickery of non-standard evaluation (NSE) as employed by most of the `dplyr` functions. In calls to `mutate`, `filter`, `group_by` and friends, column names are supplied without quotation marks. An expression like `mutate(df, rank = rank(abund))` fails when `abund` is not literally a column in the data frame. And how could you possibly know the column names in a function that handles arbitrary data frames?

NSE can be glimpsed elsewhere in R -- it's what lets you leave package names unquoted in the command `library(dplyr)`. Without NSE, that command would fail with the message <span style="color:red;">`Error: object 'dplyr' not found`</span>. After all, nothing called `dplyr` exists in the global environment. If the unquoted `dplyr` in `library(dplyr)` doesn't exist in the global environment, how can this expression achieve the same result as the standard evaluation call `library("dplyr")`? The absense of quotation marks is the proverbial tip of an iceberg, so buckle up your crampons and read on.

As a contrived example of when the savvy `dplyr` user needs to know about NSE, suppose you want to write a function that does for arbitrary data frames what the following does for `plots` (the script at the end of this post will create `plots`):

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
plots <- read.csv(textConnection("
  Plot, Genus,  Species, Cover
  1,    androp, gerar,   4
  1,    schiza, scopa,   1
  1,    panicu, virga,   6
  2,    androp, gerar,   3
  2,    panicu, virga,   4
  2,    sorgha, nutan,   1
  2,    sporob, compo,   1
"), strip.white = TRUE)
```

```{r}
plots %>%
    filter(Plot == 2) %>%
    summarize(avg = mean(Cover))
```

An **incorrect** attempt at such a function is:

```{r}
level_mean_nope <- function(data, factor, level, value) {
  data %>%
    filter(factor == level) %>%
    summarize(avg = mean(value))
}
```

The intent above is to keep rows that have the value of `level` in whichever column is named `factor`, and subsequently apply the function `mean` to whichever column is named `value`. But try it and be warned:

```{r}
level_mean_nope(plots, 'Plot', 2, 'Cover')
```

What's worse than the warning is that the answer given, `NA`, is wrong! Without the `summarize` part, the result would still not be what you'ld expect, and there would be no warning at all.

By the way, have you read the [Programming with dplyr] vignette? Did it help? Yeah, me neither ... but this stuff is hard to understand!

Let's go back to `library(dplyr)` and talk about R's lazy evaluation mechanism, or more specifically, about [promise objects]. Very briefly, when you use a function, its arguments are *not* evaluated before handing off to the function's internals. The call to `library` does not try to evaluate `dplyr` before starting through the code within the `library` function -- the interpreter is "lazy". If I were a lazy interpreter, I'd accept any note you handed me and promise to translate it when the time comes. Moreover, I'd promise to read it in the context it was given, so references in the note to 'this' or 'those' would be to things present when you gave me the note. By using the stored context, R functions appear to evaluate the function's arguments in a standard way ... it just won't unless absolutely necessary (hence "lazy").

Technically, when the R interpreter encounters a function call, each argument gets embedded in an object representing itself as an expression (i.e. a bit of code) along with a pointer to the environment in which the function was called. This promise object can evaluate the expression in that environment when needed, so it conveys the correct value like any normal variable would. But you can perform sneaky tricks with a promise object, too. The `library(dplyr)` command examines the expression `dplyr` and infers the string `"dplyr"`, without ever attempting to evaluate the expression (which would fail in the global environment!). All this to save you the trouble of typing quotation marks.

Like the `library` function, `filter` and `summarize` look at the embedded expression rather than instruct the lazy interpreter to get on with evaluating it. You **can** do the same, but **should** you?

## "Yes, I can!"

You too can write a NSE function using `substitute`, a function that will modify code itself.

Come again, now? The purpose of `substitute(expr)` is to modify `expr` using variables found in the current environment. Within a function, the environment includes the promise objects created from each argument, and `substitute(expr)` will replace any code in `expr` referencing a promise object with the promised expression (still unevaluated!).

```{r}
level_mean_nse <- function(data, factor, level, value) {
  only_this_level <- substitute(factor == level)
  mean_of_value <- substitute(mean(value))
  data %>%
    filter(!!only_this_level) %>%
    summarize(avg = !!mean_of_value)
}
```

Focus on the second line, where substitute gets the expression `factor == level`. The first part of that expression will be substituted for the *expression* embedded in the promise object `factor`, whatever it may be when `level_mean_nse` gets used. The same happens for `level`, and the result is stored as `only_this_level`. Now at line 24, notice the `!!` in the call to `filter`, and again in `summarize` on the next line. Since we are implementing our own NSE, we have to bypass the `dplyr` mechanism for lazy evaluation, and that's exactly what the `!!` prefix does. Note you could also use [rlang's] "quosure", but c'mon this isn't [lolcode].

Now try using your function with `dplyr` style unquoted arguments:

```{r}
level_mean_nse(plots, Plot, 2, Cover)
```

See how it works? The application of `filter` ended up equivalent to `filter(plots, Plot == 2)`. Sound good enough? Feel free to stop reading if you want to skip the lecture.

## "No, you shouldn't."

When you program with `substitute` (or `quo`) you are writing code to write code to do what you want. Whenever possible, just write code to do what you want. That way, the code is more readable for your colaborators, yourself two weeks from now, and the consumers of your open source contribution. The code is also easier to develop and debug. You cannot, for example, get the body of `level_mean_nse` working first and wrap it up in a `function() {}` last, because `substitute` only works right inside a function call.

You should know how to avoid NSE altogether by treating column names as what they are, strings. Newer versions of `dplyr` that import `rlang` provde a `.data` object to get around NSE. The `.data` object is something like the original data but as processed "so far". Subset `.data` in the normal way, referencing columns by name, within any of the `dplyr` verbs:

```{r}
data <- plots
factor <- 'Plot'
level <- 2
value <- 'Cover'

data %>%
  filter(.data[[factor]] == level) %>%
  summarise(avg = mean(.data[[value]]))
```

With that working, wrap it up in `level_mean <- function(data, factor, level, value) {...}` and you are good to go.

## tl;dr

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(dplyr)

plots <- read.csv(textConnection("
  Plot, Genus,  Species, Cover
  1,    androp, gerar,   4
  1,    schiza, scopa,   1
  1,    panicu, virga,   6
  2,    androp, gerar,   3
  2,    panicu, virga,   4
  2,    sorgha, nutan,   1
  2,    sporob, compo,   1
"), strip.white = TRUE)

# goal: a function to do the following for arbitrary data frames
plots %>%
  filter(Plot == 2) %>%
  summarize(avg = mean(Cover))

# this won't work
level_mean_nope <- function(data, factor, level, value) {
  data %>%
    filter(factor == level) %>%
    summarize(avg = mean(value))
}
level_mean_nope(plots, Plot, 2, Cover)

# you could write your own NSE function
level_mean_nse <- function(data, factor, level, value) {
  only_this_level <- substitute(factor == level)
  mean_of_value <- substitute(mean(value))
  data %>%
    filter(!!only_this_level) %>%
    summarize(avg = !!mean_of_value)
}
level_mean_nse(plots, Plot, 2, Cover)

# you should avoid NSE altogether
level_mean <- function(data, factor, level, value) {
  data %>%
    filter(.data[[factor]] == level) %>%
    summarize(avg = mean(.data[[value]]))
}
level_mean(plots, 'Plot', 2, 'Cover')
```
