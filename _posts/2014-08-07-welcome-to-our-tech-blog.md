# {{ page.title }}

Over the past few years we've been operating our tech staff has slowly
built up a list of tips, tricks and a library of small code or process
snippits that we've found useful. It's now time to share! So from now
on, we'll be using this site to both record our institutional memory,
provide links to quick tips and descriptions of coding projects that
we'll be making available.
