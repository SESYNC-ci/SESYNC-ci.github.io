> What page should badges link to? SOme Possibilities: cyberhelp lessons page (just stable lessons), curriculum project page https://github.com/orgs/SESYNC-ci/projects/2, this markdown document or a rendered version of it somewhere

> Had previously considered calling archived category "deprecated" but I think we agreed "archived" was more intuitive.
