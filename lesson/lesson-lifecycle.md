# SESYNC Data Science Lessons

This page describes the lifecycle categories of SESYNC's data science lessons. 

## Alpha

Alpha lessons are experimental, incomplete, or in development. These may be new lessons that have not been taught yet, or have issues that need to be addressed because the content is confusing or misleading.

## Beta

Beta lessons are complete but likely have open issues to improve content. They have generally been "field tested" at least once in a workshop and should not contain entirely outdated material, but are not necessarily maintained. Therefore any issues that arise will likely not be addressed until the lesson is planned to be used in a workshop. These lessons may also rely on access to SESYNC infrastructure.

## Stable

Stable lessons are actively maintained and should be self-contained with an active "handouts" link at the top of the lesson view.

## Archived

Archived lessons are not maintained. Content may not be accurate. Lesson material is preserved for reference.
