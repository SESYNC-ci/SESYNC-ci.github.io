For new groups, we generally follow the timeline below:

1. **Day of priming call** - Shortly before or after your priming call, SESYNC IT staff will email a group's PI's letting them know their group mailing list has been created.

2. **One week before your first meeting** - All group members listed on your travel form will receive an email listing the group mailing list and instructions on setting up their account.

### Why don't you fully setup the group when you award?

The two big reasons we don't setup your group or notify your members further in advance: 
* First, unless there is a reason for your group members to have access to resources, most folks will disregard or misplace an email sent about a meeting several months in advance. 
* Second, we often see group members get added or changed leading up to the first meeting.

### Can I have access early if we need to share documents?

Yes, if you're starting your group virtually we will certainly setup your site early. Just drop our IT staff an email w/ the list of your group members and we'll take care of the rest.
