SESYNC provides remote access to all desktop resources through a browser based Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).
Browse to <https://desktop.sesync.org> and login with your SESYNC username and password. Select one of the
virtual machines to connect to its desktop (only machines you have permission to access are shown).
