SESYNC's data storage and computational resources are available to pursuit participants for approximately **one year after** the final meeting to allow completion of project-related tasks. 

Cyberinfrastructure staff will participate in an **Exit Meeting** with PI's during the project's final meeting at SESYNC. At that time, we will review the data and computational resources allocated to the project and agree on a plan for their transfer to other service providers identified by the PIs. The cyberinfrastructure staff can help identify a [long-term repository for data]({{ 'quickstart/sharing-data-products.html' | relative_url }}) and other service providers. Please email <{{ site.email }}> with any questions.
