SESYNC uses the sympa mailing list server to manage mailing lists. 
You can manage your list by going to [lists.sesync.org](https://lists.sesync.org) and entering your e-mail address and SESYNC password in the upper right. 

**Unlike other SESYNC services,  you will need to use the e-mail address attached to your account (ie, bsmith@university.edu) and not your SESYNC username.**

Once you login, you will see a list of lists for which you are an administrator on the left. 
Click the found 'admin' button to the left of the list you want to modify.

### How do I add subscribers to the mailing list?

The mailing list may be configured in one of two ways:
1. Automatically include members from a group via SESYNC accounts

2. Manually control who is in the group following steps below:
   * Adding the member users email by going to **Admin** and selecting **Manage Subscribers**
   ![Subscribe](/assets/images/sympa3.png)
   
   * You can the subscribe members to the list via individual or bulk addition

   * **Unless quiet addition is selected, members will get an email notification of their addition to the list**
