In our all-virtual work world now, it can be very useful to have multiple ways of communicating with your team.  Having multiple lines of communication can provide for all people to have input in a way they are comfortable with, and foster asynchronous collaboration.  It also makes the work of your team more transparent to all participants.  

There are many technological solutions out there, but figuring out what the options are, and how to use them effectively in combination may be more difficult.  Here we list some tech options, and provide a few examples of how teams or SESYNC staff has effectively used these tech solutions.

----------------------------

# What tech is available and what have other SESYNC teams been using?

Note: The asterisk(*) indicates at least one SESYNC team is using this technology solution.

### Video Calls

Video calls allow you to meet virtually and see the other participants via video.  Most also allow participation via phone (without video) as well.  

 - Zoom*
 - WebEx
 - Skype
 - GoToMeeting
 
### Messaging

Messaging can be an important alternate way to communicate, both during and between video calls.

 - Slack*
 - Microsoft Teams*
 - Consider Whattsapp or texting* (if your team members are comfortable sharing their phone numbers)
 - Also consider phone calls* (again, only if your team is willing to share their phone numbers)
 
### Document Creation/Editing/Storage

Storing and sharing documents in one centralized place is important in collaborative projects to ensure everyone is working from the same starting point.  

 - Google Drive*
 - Microsoft Teams*
 - Box
 - Dropbox*
 
### Project/Workflow Management

Managing tasks and deadlines can be aided by using project management solutions.  

 - [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/)*
 - [Whole Tale](https://wholetale.org/)
 - [GitHub](https://github.com)*  
 - [GitLab](https://gitlab.com)*
 - [Trello](https://trello.com/)

### Brainstorming/Diagramming

"Whiteboard" technology can aid in brainstorming or diagramming exercises in an all-virtual setting.

# How might my team effectively use these tech solutions? 

### Minimally technical team 
 - Use email, and track changes in MSWord. Use phone calls, maybe with multiple team members. 

### Team willing to use some technological solutions
 - Use Zoom for meetings, Google Docs for editing files, and phone calls for additional communication.
 
### Technologically savvy team
 - Use GitHub to manage project, Google Drive to share/edit docs, Slack to chat, and Zoom to video conference. 
 
  
# Anecdotes from SESYNC teams
 - _Asynchronous collaboration has been useful - it has been difficult to move from Google Drive to Microsoft Teams, but the asynchronous aspect works well._ - Systems of Systems Pursuit

 - _We had good success using Slack and Zoom to teach a course this summer.  We also used pre-recorded videos for asynchronous information delivery._ - SESYNC Data Science Team
 
 - _A combination of short Zoom meetings with discussion in Google Docs to refine research questions proved useful.  Team members did not engage on Zoom meetings, but lots of engagement on the Google Docs._ - Diversity in Eco-Function Pursuit
