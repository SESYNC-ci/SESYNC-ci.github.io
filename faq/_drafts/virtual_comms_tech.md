In our all-virtual work world now, it can be very useful to have multiple ways of communicating with your team.  Having multiple lines of communication can provide for all people to have input in a way they are comfortable with, and foster asynchronous collaboration.  

There are many technological solutions out there, but figuring out what the options are, and how to use them effectively in combination may be more difficult.  Here we list some tech options, and provide a few examples of how teams or SESYNC staff has effectively used these tech solutions.
