In our all-virtual work world now, it can be very useful to have multiple ways of communicating with your team.  Having multiple lines of communication can provide for all people to have input in a way they are comfortable with, and foster asynchronous collaboration.  

There are many technological solutions out there, but figuring out what the options are, and how to use them effectively in combination may be more difficult.  Here we list some tech options, and provide a few examples of how teams or SESYNC staff has effectively used these tech solutions.

----------------------------

# What tech is available and what have other SESYNC teams been using?

# How might my team effectively use these tech solutions? 

### Completely non-technical team 
 - Use pen and paper and the USPS.

### Team willing to use some technological solutions
 - Use Zoom for meetings, Google Docs for editing files, and phone calls for additional communication.
 
### Technologically savvy team
 - Use GitHub to manage project, Google Drive to share/edit docs, Slack to chat, and Zoom to video conference. 
 
  
# Anecdotes from SESYNC teams
 - _Asynchronous collaboration has been useful - it has been difficult to move from Google Drive to Microsoft Teams, but the asynchronous aspect works well._ - Systems of Systems Pursuit

 - _We had good success using Slack and Zoom to teach a course this summer.  We also used pre-recorded videos for asynchronous information delivery._ - SESYNC Data Science Team
 
 - _A combination of short Zoom meetings with discussion in Google Docs to refine research questions proved useful.  Team members did not engage on Zoom meetings, but lots of engagement on the Google Docs._ - Diversity in Eco-Function Pursuit
