SESYNC computational resources are available to users for approximately 1 year after your last group meeting.

SESYNC Cyberinfrastructure staff will reach out to Group PI's prior to their last scheduled meeting to plan a **Closeout Meeting**. In the meeting, CI staff will discuss your currently allocated computational resources and plan a retirement and transfer process for your group's data and computational resources. Our staff can also help you identify a long-term repository for your data.

Please contact cyberhelp@sesync.org with any questions.
